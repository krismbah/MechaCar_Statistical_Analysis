## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

"Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?" According to the summary outpuut, the "ground_clearance" and "vehicle_length" (as well as the intercept) variables were statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the "mpg" values in the linear model. In other words, the "ground_clearance" and "vehicle_length" (as well as the intercept) variables have a significant impact on vehicle miles-per-gallon. Furthermore, "vehicle_weight" may also provide a slight amount of variance to "mpg" values, but not of noteable significance when considering a significance level of 0.05.

"Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?" The p-value of our of the hypothesis test is 5.35e-11. This is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. This means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

"Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?" According to the multiple r-squared value of 0.7149, the multiple linear regression model will predict "mpg" values of MechaCar prototypes correctly approximately 71 percent of the time.
